The automated driving technology is developing at an amazing speed, but the research and development direction of the automated driving technology focuses on dealing with the regu- lar driving working environment, and to ensure that the automated driving car can complete the driving task safely and efficiently, it is necessary to pay more attention to the research of the automated driving technology in the extreme driving working environment.
Racing is the catalyst for the advancement of self-driving technology, and self-driving race cars, as a kind of research that explores the edge cases of self-driving, happen to be the ideal testing ground for all kinds of self-driving algorithms [2]. As a result, in recent years there have been a number of events and competitions in the field, such as the F1/10th race series and the Indy Autono- mous Challenge.
However, it is still a major challenge to ensure autonomous driving in self- driving car races at high speeds, high acceleration, low reaction times, dynamic and adversarial environments.

based on ubuntu system
1. construct work space(catkin_ws)

2. install F1TENTH simulator from git link

3. Compile code using catkin_make

4. Configure the environment in setup.bash

5. run ROS, roslaunch f1tenth_simulator simulator.luanch

6. implement node, rosrun planning_pkg xxxx.py
